# dsa-sorting-algorithm-visualizer
This project is an interactive web application that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step. It helps users understand the logic and efficiency behind each algorithm through smooth, real-time animations and dynamic UI interactions.

Built using React with the Vite build tool, the application offers a fast and responsive experience. Users can choose from various sorting algorithms, adjust the array size and animation speed, and observe how the data gets sorted in a visually intuitive manner.
